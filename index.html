                                                <p>In the fall of 2022, I began a transforming adventure as a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the ENED (Engineering Design and Thinking) course at the University of Cincinnati. This work, which I initially saw as a chance to expand my work experience being my first part-time job, turned out to be a complex experience which lead to the expansion of engineering principles that had a big impact on my personal and professional development. It gave me the opportunity to learn important skills, make meaningful connections with first-year students, and think about my future goals in engineering and administration.</p>
                                                <p>I was ecstatic when I accepted the ENED TA position, I expected to be evaluating assignments and aiding the professor with administrative work. However, I rapidly learned that the obligations greatly exceeded my initial expectations. My primary responsibilities included facilitating class discussions, leading mentoring sessions, concentrated exam preparation, and offering individual assistance to students with their final project development. The course was designed to educate first-year engineering students to design thinking and problem-solving approaches, with both difficulties and rewards.</p>
                                                <p>One of the most memorable initiatives was assisting students through the construction of an autonomous object retrieval robot. This project required students to use their theoretical knowledge in programming in LabView and Python while also encouraging them to think critically about practical challenges and material limitations. My goal was to guide them through ideation sessions, prototyping, and final presentations. It was quite rewarding to watch them transform from nervous beginners to confident presenters.</p>
                                                <p>This experience had a significant impact on me. Primarily it improved my communication skills. Explaining intricate engineering ideas in a way that first-year students could understand required both clarity and patience. I learnt to customize my explanations to varied learning styles, ensuring that all students understood the information. This talent has been helpful in my academic and professional life, especially as I pursue my MBA</p>
                                                <p>Likewise, this role enabled me to have a greater understanding for collaborative learning. The classroom was a lively setting in which ideas were continuously shared, and I witnessed firsthand the importance of varied perspectives in problem solutions. This experience reaffirmed the value of teamwork and collaboration in engineering, which I will keep with me as I pursue my MBA and future profession.</p>
                                                <p>The opportunity I had to conduct mentoring sessions for students was a big part of my experience. Many of them had to deal with the same difficulties and doubts that I had in my first year. Many were dealing with anxiety and were doubting their choice of majors. I was able to assist them in overcoming these challenges and gaining confidence by providing direction and assistance. My grasp of the course subject and college-life balance was challenged and reinforced by this mentoring role, which also gave me a sense of leadership and responsibility.</p>
                                                <p>Reflecting on my time as a TA, I realize how this experience has shaped my perspective on my aspirations and how I am going to pursue them. The skills I developedâ€”effective communication, collaboration, and mentorshipâ€”are essential for any leadership role, particularly in the intersection of engineering and entrepreneurship. As I continue my studies in the ACCEND program, I am more confident in my ability to bridge the gap between technical expertise and business acumen.</p>
                                                <p>I'm determined to use these abilities going forward to contribute to the engineering community and beyond. My goal is to assume leadership positions where I can motivate and encourage creative approaches to challenging issues. Another thing that has piqued interest in academics is the experience of coaching first-year students. I can now envision myself going back to the classroom in the futureâ€”not just as a practitioner, but also as an instructor, able to motivate the following generation of engineers. I eventually did return back to campus after my co-op as an Academic Coach in the Learning Commons.</p>
                                                <p>I also discovered the value of empathy and flexibility from this experience. Since every student is different and has a different learning style, it was essential for me to modify my teaching strategies to suit each student's needs. For instance, during a particularly spatial visualization lesson, I observed that a few students were having trouble understanding the abstract ideas. In order to address this, I developed a set of short instructions from my notes that provided a more concrete illustration of the concepts. This method improved the students' comprehension of the concept while also enhancing their confidence in the learning process.</p>
                                                <p>Everything considered, my experience working as a Teaching Assistant for the ENED course was crucial and had a big influence on my professional and personal growth. It reaffirmed how crucial mentorship, group learning, and effective communication are. I have no doubt that these teachings will help me in my MBA program and future employment. In addition, the experience has made me think about the wider influence I may have in the engineering and business fields, and I'm eager to see where this path takes me.</p>
                                                <p>My experience, involved juggling technical advice, emotional support, and administrative duties, helped me grow holistically and has equipped me for the complex demands of my future career. I am appreciative that I had the chance to positively influence my students' lives and that I developed so much in the process. I'm determined to put these teachings into practice and pursue excellence in all I do as I advance in my education and profession.</p>
                                                <p>In the end, participating as a teaching assistant (TA) for the University of Cincinnati's Engineering Design and Thinking course was more than just a job; it was a path for personal development. Coming to campus from the opposite end of the Earth, it was a chance for me to hone my abilities, comprehend the importance of mentoring, andâ€”above allâ€”realize the enormous influence that committed support and leadership can have on other people in a new culture and class no less than a melting pot of diverse young engineers in the making. My academic and professional development has been greatly aided by this experience, and I am eager to use the lessons I've learned as I continue to improve.</p>

                                                <p>I am an international student from Lucknow, India, studying Computer Science in the United States, where my journey has been a blend of excitement, growth, and occasional homesickness. After three years of immersion in American culture and academics, I eagerly anticipated returning to India during the Winter Break of 2023. This trip was not just about reuniting with my parents but also about sharing my heritage with my Western friends. It was a unique opportunity to introduce them to my city, culture, traditions, and the essence of my life back home. This is a reflection on the profound impact this experience had on not just myself but all of us.</p>
                                                <p>The idea of bringing my friends to India had emerged during one of our numerous FaceTime calls with my parents when my partner expressed her sincere wish to visit India and the next minute my Dad decided to get us tickets. I believe my father was missing me more than I could fathom. My fellow engineering majors and my close friends were always curious about India. I saw this trip as a chance to bridge the cultural gap between our worlds. The anticipation of showing them my city, my roots, and everything that shaped me was thrilling.</p>
                                                <p>Our journey began with a long flight from Dulles to New Delhi, taking a stop at Dubai. As we landed in New Delhi, I was overwhelmed with a mix of emotionsâ€”excitement, nostalgia, and a little bit of nervousness. For my friends, it was their first time in India, and the vibrant chaos of the city was both exhilarating and overwhelming. From the moment we stepped out of the airport, the adventure began.</p>
                                                <p>One of the first places I took them was to my home. The warmth and affection with which my parents welcomed them set the tone for the rest of the trip. We spent hours in my living room, catching up, laughing, and indulging in home-cooked Indian meals that I have been craving for 3 years now. My mother's culinary skills left my friends in awe, and they quickly developed a fondness for all the Indian vegetarian dishes my mother had been waiting to cook for me.</p>
                                                <p>This experience was profoundly impactful somaesthetically. Primarily, it allowed me to rediscover my own culture through another perspective, which deepened my appreciation for my heritage. Watching my friends navigate the bustling streets of Lucknow, trying to learn the language, relish the flavors of Indian cuisine, and marvel at the historical landmarks made me realize the richness of my cultural background that I had been ignoring in a drive to move west for studies.</p>
                                                <p>Visiting my high school was a nostalgic trip down memory lane. I spent 14 years of my life there. My favorite moment was when I let them know I had school on Saturdays as well. My partner was fascinated by the different educational system and the sense of discipline, sheer competition and respect that was deeply ingrained in our school culture. We walked through the corridors where I had spent my formative years, shared laughs with my old teachers that happened to be in the lobby, and relived memories that shaped my early years. My partner recounts this as their favorite day, this was an eye-opener to the global diversity in education and the universal values of learning and growth.</p>
                                                <p>The next day we went exploring the historical and cultural landmarks of Lucknow. The grandeur of the Old Lucknow, with its intricate architecture and historical significance, left my friends spellbound. We wandered through the labyrinthine hallways of the Hazratganj skimming through hand-crafted shoes and perfumes and buying Christmas gifts, sharing stories of the Kings and the rich history of the city. At the Hanuman Setu Temple, the beauty of the marble carvings and the divinity of the place offered a stark contrast to the hustle and bustle of the city. I had spent all of life visiting the temple with my parents and spending time with young scholars there. It was one of the most enriching experiences and impactful in understanding the spiritual fabric of Indian society. The tranquility of the Hanuman Setu Temple and the rituals performed there fascinated and appreciated by everyone. It was an opportunity for us to witness the diverse religious practices that coexist in India and for me to rediscover and appreciate the spiritual depth of my culture.</p>
                                                <p>My father had initiated a culinary journey which was an adventure in itself. From savoring food at the renowned Royal CafÃ© to enjoying fine dining experiences at traditional Awadhi restaurants, each meal was a cultural exploration, interestingly all vegetarian. My friendsâ€™ enthusiasm for trying new dishes and their genuine appreciation for the flavors and spices was heartening. It was a reminder of how food can be a powerful connector between cultures. We had many discussions on the important differences between flavorful spices and pure bland hotness that usually linked to some stereotypes as well. The trip continued with multiple visits to the famous supermalls and the Asiaâ€™s largest park as well as silk craft exhibitions and other artist presentations.</p>
                                                <p>Reflecting on this trip, I realize how it has enriched my life. For me, it was a journey of rediscoveryâ€”seeing my city, my culture, and my traditions through a fresh perspective. It deepened my connection to my roots and filled me with a renewed sense of confidence in my heritage. It also reminded me of the importance of cultural exchange and the beauty of sharing one's heritage with others.  We returned to the United States with somesthetic memories, a profound appreciation for Indian culture, and a lot of Christmas gifts. This experience has sparked my interest in exploring more about different cultures and traditions, fostering a sense of global citizenship. This trip reinforced the idea that stepping out of one's comfort zone can lead to the most rewarding experiences. My goal during the initial stages of the Honors Program was focusing on the various international opportunities available and being my definition of the Global Citizen Scholar. It encouraged me to embrace new challenges, seek out diverse perspectives, and continue learning and growing. It made me believe stronger in my ambitions and affirm that I am on the right track in life. As I pursue my studies and future career, I am more confident in my ability to adapt to new environments and connect with people from different backgrounds. As I reflect on this adventure, I am filled with gratitude for the memories we created and the lessons we learned. I am currently planning another impactful experience for the upcoming break in 2024 with my friends.</p>

                                            <p>My third year at the University of Cincinnati was loaded with new experiences, challenges, and opportunities. This year came with a variety of activities that increased my academic experience, career development, and personal life.</p>
                                            <p>The fall of 2023 was a significant moment for me, as I began a semester-long internship in Cincinnati. This opportunity came with a considerable responsibility for software development. It was a difficult undertaking that needed me to utilize a self-starter approachÂ in a real-world situation while also demanding leadership and professional traits that I had to rapidly adapt to and improve.</p>
                                            <p>Working on the project from inception to deployment taught me how to manage my time properly, report progress to my supervisors, and fix difficulties swiftly. This event taught me the value of self-reliance and initiative. I also learned a lot about how to operate in a team and how important each member's input is to the success of the project. This was also the semester in which I was officially admitted to the MBA program at the Carl H. Lindner College of Business via the ACCEND program. Looking at the potential schedule for my future semesters triggered a variety of feelings, but thrill stood out. The excitement of pursuing something completely different, and the fact that I will graduate twice in one semester! I also got admitted into the prestigious University Honors Program, making me part of a community that will help me pave a stronger foundation for my present and future.</p>
                                            <p>During the winter break, I had the pleasure of taking my American friends to my hometown of Lucknow, India. This trip was a combination of cultural exchange and personal joy, as I experienced Christmas with my parents and friends in India. Sharing my culture, traditions, and the liveliness of my city with my friends was an extremely rewarding experience. We visited temples, enjoyed home-cooked meals, took part in numerous cultural celebrations, and shopped a lot. This journey opened my friends to a different side of the world, deepening their awareness and appreciation for Indian culture. For me, it was an opportunity to reconnect with my roots and see my city through new eyes. This cultural exchange created so many new memories that I will always cherish.</p>
                                            <p>The spring semester of 2024 was academically enriching and stimulated my creative appetite. One of the highlights was taking the class - Introduction to Greek History. This course was extremely exciting and was one of the classes that I made sure I never missed. Every lecture was fascinating and the professor made the entire course feel like a Netflix series. In addition to that class I decided to diverse my experience more and enrolled in a woodworking class. This hands-on experience was a refreshing break from my usual technical coursework. This class of 5 engineering guys (coincidence?) took place on the VPC Campus under a really awesome professor who kept us hyped up all the time and gave us occasional Final Destination references! I built a walnut-poplar shaker-style end table and did a little custom profiling on it. This class left me extremely energized and sucked all the stress out of my life. This project was immensely satisfying as it combined creativity, precision, and craftsmanship. The skills I developed in woodworking added a completely new dimension to my abilities.</p>
                                            <p>Spring 2024 also marked the beginning of my MBA program, with foundational classes in finance and accounting. These classes were challenging but really rewarding and most importantly thrilling. They gave an excellent foundation in business principles and financial management, which proved critical to my overall development. The coursework was challenging, but it was fascinating to learn about the complexities of financial markets, corporate finance, and accounting practices. In addition to my academic interests, I discovered a new one: golf. I began playing golf as a recreational sport and discovered it to be an excellent way to relax and unwind. It made me realize all the fun in life beyond the four walls of the classroom. Despite the busy schedule, I maintained a strong academic performance and made it to the Deanâ€™s List with a 4.0 in both my majors, which was a proud moment for me.</p>
                                            <p>I'm now returning to the same firm for another semester-long internship, with the goal of starting and leading a new project. This time, I'm more confident and prepared, having learned from my past experience. This year was an eventful one spanning across multiple realms ofÂ personal growth.</p>
                                            <p>Looking back, I feel grateful for both the opportunities and challenges that this year brought. They have prepared me for future pursuits and increased my resilience andÂ adaptability. As I continue my journey at the University of Cincinnati, I am excited about all the possibilities that await me and am eager to take advantage of them all. This year really showed the importance of accepting varied experiences and the ongoing pursuit of knowledge and progress.</p>
