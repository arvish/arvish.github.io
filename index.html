                                                <p> In the fall of 2022, I began a transforming adventure as a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the ENED (Engineering Design and Thinking) course at the University of Cincinnati. Initially seen as a chance to expand my work experience, this role turned out to be a profound learning opportunity that significantly impacted my personal and professional development. As a TA, I was not only responsible for evaluating assignments but also facilitating class discussions, leading mentoring sessions, and assisting students with their final projects.</p>
                                                <p> One of the most memorable projects involved guiding students through the construction of an autonomous object retrieval robot. This hands-on experience allowed me to improve my communication skills, as I explained complex engineering concepts in a way that first-year students could grasp. Additionally, I gained a deeper appreciation for collaborative learning, witnessing firsthand the value of diverse perspectives in problem-solving.</p>
                                                <p> Mentoring students was a particularly rewarding aspect of my role. Many faced the same challenges I had as a freshman, and I was able to help them navigate these obstacles and gain confidence. This experience reinforced my understanding of the course material and honed my leadership skills.</p>
                                                <p> Reflecting on my time as a TA, I recognize the essential skills I developedâ€”effective communication, collaboration, and mentorshipâ€”which are crucial for any leadership role. As I continue my studies in the ACCEND program, I am more confident in bridging the gap between technical expertise and business acumen. This experience has also sparked an interest in possibly returning to academia as an instructor, further contributing to the engineering community.</p>
                                                <p> My time as a TA for the ENED course was a pivotal experience that has profoundly influenced my career aspirations and personal growth.</p>

                                                <p> I am an international student from Lucknow, India, studying Computer Science in the United States, and my journey has been a blend of excitement, growth, and occasional homesickness. After three years immersed in American culture and academics, I eagerly anticipated my return to India during the Winter Break of 2023. This trip was not just about reuniting with my parents but also sharing my heritage with my Western friends. The idea emerged during a FaceTime call when my partner expressed a desire to visit India, prompting my father to book tickets immediately.</p>
                                                <p> Our journey began with a long flight from Dulles to New Delhi. For my friends, it was their first time in India, and the vibrant chaos of the city was both exhilarating and overwhelming. One of the first places I took them was my home. The warmth and affection with which my parents welcomed them set the tone for the rest of the trip.</p>
                                                <p> This experience allowed me to rediscover my own culture through another perspective, deepening my appreciation for my heritage. Watching my friends navigate the bustling streets of Lucknow, trying to learn the language, relish Indian cuisine, and marvel at the historical landmarks made me realize the richness of my cultural background.</p>
                                                <p> Visiting my high school was a nostalgic trip down memory lane. My partner was fascinated by the different educational system and the discipline ingrained in our school culture. Exploring the historical and cultural landmarks of Lucknow left my friends spellbound.  The tranquility of the Hanuman Setu Temple and the rituals performed there offered a stark contrast to the city's hustle and bustle.</p>
                                                <p> Reflecting on this trip, I realize how it has enriched my life. For me, it was a journey of rediscovery, seeing my city, my culture, and my traditions through a fresh perspective.</p>

                                            <p>My third year at the University of Cincinnati was loaded with new experiences, challenges, and opportunities. This year came with a variety of activities that increased my academic experience, career development, and personal life.</p>
                                            <p>The fall of 2023 was a significant moment for me, as I began a semester-long internship in Cincinnati. This opportunity came with a considerable responsibility for software development. It was a difficult undertaking that needed me to utilize a self-starter approachÂ in a real-world situation while also demanding leadership and professional traits that I had to rapidly adapt to and improve.</p>
                                            <p>Working on the project from inception to deployment taught me how to manage my time properly, report progress to my supervisors, and fix difficulties swiftly. This event taught me the value of self-reliance and initiative. I also learned a lot about how to operate in a team and how important each member's input is to the success of the project. This was also the semester in which I was officially admitted to the MBA program at the Carl H. Lindner College of Business via the ACCEND program. Looking at the potential schedule for my future semesters triggered a variety of feelings, but thrill stood out. The excitement of pursuing something completely different, and the fact that I will graduate twice in one semester! I also got admitted into the prestigious University Honors Program, making me part of a community that will help me pave a stronger foundation for my present and future.</p>
                                            <p>During the winter break, I had the pleasure of taking my American friends to my hometown of Lucknow, India. This trip was a combination of cultural exchange and personal joy, as I experienced Christmas with my parents and friends in India. Sharing my culture, traditions, and the liveliness of my city with my friends was an extremely rewarding experience. We visited temples, enjoyed home-cooked meals, took part in numerous cultural celebrations, and shopped a lot. This journey opened my friends to a different side of the world, deepening their awareness and appreciation for Indian culture. For me, it was an opportunity to reconnect with my roots and see my city through new eyes. This cultural exchange created so many new memories that I will always cherish.</p>
                                            <p>The spring semester of 2024 was academically enriching and stimulated my creative appetite. One of the highlights was taking the class - Introduction to Greek History. This course was extremely exciting and was one of the classes that I made sure I never missed. Every lecture was fascinating and the professor made the entire course feel like a Netflix series. In addition to that class I decided to diverse my experience more and enrolled in a woodworking class. This hands-on experience was a refreshing break from my usual technical coursework. This class of 5 engineering guys (coincidence?) took place on the VPC Campus under a really awesome professor who kept us hyped up all the time and gave us occasional Final Destination references! I built a walnut-poplar shaker-style end table and did a little custom profiling on it. This class left me extremely energized and sucked all the stress out of my life. This project was immensely satisfying as it combined creativity, precision, and craftsmanship. The skills I developed in woodworking added a completely new dimension to my abilities.</p>
                                            <p>Spring 2024 also marked the beginning of my MBA program, with foundational classes in finance and accounting. These classes were challenging but really rewarding and most importantly thrilling. They gave an excellent foundation in business principles and financial management, which proved critical to my overall development. The coursework was challenging, but it was fascinating to learn about the complexities of financial markets, corporate finance, and accounting practices. In addition to my academic interests, I discovered a new one: golf. I began playing golf as a recreational sport and discovered it to be an excellent way to relax and unwind. It made me realize all the fun in life beyond the four walls of the classroom. Despite the busy schedule, I maintained a strong academic performance and made it to the Deanâ€™s List with a 4.0 in both my majors, which was a proud moment for me.</p>
                                            <p>I'm now returning to the same firm for another semester-long internship, with the goal of starting and leading a new project. This time, I'm more confident and prepared, having learned from my past experience. This year was an eventful one spanning across multiple realms ofÂ personal growth.</p>
                                            <p>Looking back, I feel grateful for both the opportunities and challenges that this year brought. They have prepared me for future pursuits and increased my resilience andÂ adaptability. As I continue my journey at the University of Cincinnati, I am excited about all the possibilities that await me and am eager to take advantage of them all. This year really showed the importance of accepting varied experiences and the ongoing pursuit of knowledge and progress.</p>
