**Development of my E-Portfolio Website. 
Developed for flexing skills and interesting projects behind-the-scenes. Includes pictures of past feats and future updates. Completely responsive UI/UX. A webapp under development to be linked to this website. With a separate dash, the webapp will be Heroku based and will recognize facial features in a frame.
